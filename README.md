The website has been created for my friends' start up. They grow organic herbs at home and want to use this website to sell their products to customers. 

Name of organization: The Royal Goyal Gardens 

The website has 4 html docs:
1. Home page (index)
2. Place Order (to know more about the products and place an order)
2. Meet the Team (info about team members)
3. Contac Us (contact details of the org)

The webpages are linked to each other to help customers easily navigate from one page to another. 
The HTML guidelines have been followed and all elemnets have been used at least once.
